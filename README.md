Blue Oyster OCR API
==================================

This is a Express & ES6 REST API for Blue Oyster OCR.

- ES6 support via [babel](https://babeljs.io)
- REST resources as middleware via [resource-router-middleware](https://github.com/developit/resource-router-middleware)
- CORS support via [cors](https://github.com/troygoode/node-cors)
- Body Parsing via [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)

> Tip: If you are using [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose), you can automatically expose your Models as REST resources using [restful-mongoose](https://git.io/restful-mongoose).
